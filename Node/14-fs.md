# fs Module 

The `fs` (File System) module is a core module in Node.js that provides an API for interacting with the file system. It allows you to perform various file-related operations, such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting files, working with directories, and more.

**Importing the fs Module:**
To use the `fs` module, you need to import it first. In Node.js, you can import core modules using the `require()` function:

```javascript
const fs = require('Node/14-fs');
```

**Common fs Methods:**

1. **Reading Files:**

- `fs.readFile(path[, options], callback)`:
  Reads data from a file asynchronously and passes the data to the provided callback. The data is returned as a Buffer unless an encoding option is specified.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
  });
  ```

- `fs.readFileSync(path[, options])`:
  Reads data from a file synchronously and returns the data as a Buffer unless an encoding option is specified.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(data);
  ```

2. **Writing to Files:**

- `fs.writeFile(file, data[, options], callback)`:
  Writes data to a file asynchronously. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.writeFile('output.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Data written to file!');
  });
  ```

- `fs.writeFileSync(file, data[, options])`:
  Writes data to a file synchronously. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.writeFileSync('output.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!');
  console.log('Data written to file!');
  ```

3. **Working with Directories:**

- `fs.mkdir(path[, options], callback)`:
  Creates a new directory asynchronously.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.mkdir('new_dir', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Directory created!');
  });
  ```

- `fs.mkdirSync(path[, options])`:
  Creates a new directory synchronously.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.mkdirSync('new_dir');
  console.log('Directory created!');
  ```

- `fs.readdir(path[, options], callback)`:
  Reads the contents of a directory asynchronously and passes an array of file names to the provided callback.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.readdir('.', (err, files) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(files);
  });
  ```

- `fs.readdirSync(path[, options])`:
  Reads the contents of a directory synchronously and returns an array of file names.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  const files = fs.readdirSync('.');
  console.log(files);
  ```

4. **Other Common Methods:**

- `fs.exists(path, callback)`:
  Checks if a file or directory exists asynchronously.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.exists('example.txt', (exists) => {
    console.log(exists ? 'File exists' : 'File does not exist');
  });
  ```

- `fs.existsSync(path)`:
  Checks if a file or directory exists synchronously.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  const exists = fs.existsSync('example.txt');
  console.log(exists ? 'File exists' : 'File does not exist');
  ```

- `fs.stat(path, callback)`:
  Returns information about a file or directory asynchronously.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  fs.stat('example.txt', (err, stats) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(stats);
  });
  ```

- `fs.statSync(path)`:
  Returns information about a file or directory synchronously.

  Example:
  ```javascript
  const stats = fs.statSync('example.txt');
  console.log(stats);
  ```

**Error Handling:**
All asynchronous methods in the `fs` module accept a callback function as the last argument. The callback function should handle any errors that may occur during the operation. If an error occurs, the first argument passed to the callback will be an error object.

**Summary:**
- The `fs` module in Node.js provides an API for interacting with the file system.
- It allows you to read from and write to files, create and delete files, work with directories, and more.
- You can import the `fs` module using `const fs = require('fs');`.
- The module provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for various file-related operations.
- Always handle errors when using asynchronous methods by providing a callback function as the last argument.

The `fs` module is a powerful tool for working with files and directories in Node.js applications. It enables you to build applications that can read, write, and manipulate files and directories efficiently, making it an essential component for file-related tasks in Node.js projects.
