# Node.js Streams - Complete Documentation**

Node.js streams are a powerful feature that allows you to efficiently process data in chunks rather than loading the entire data into memory. Streams provide an abstract interface for working with data, making it easier to work with data that might be too large to fit into memory at once or data that arrives in a continuous flow, such as network data or file data.

**Types of Streams:**

Node.js streams are categorized into four types:

1. **Readable Streams:**
   Readable streams allow you to read data from a source. For example, reading data from a file, reading data from a network request, or reading data from the standard input (stdin). Readable streams emit `'data'` events when new data is available and a `'end'` event when there is no more data to be read.

2. **Writable Streams:**
   Writable streams allow you to write data to a destination. For example, writing data to a file, sending data in a network response, or writing data to the standard output (stdout). Writable streams have a `write()` method that allows you to write data, and they emit a `'finish'` event when all data has been written.

3. **Duplex Streams:**
   Duplex streams are both readable and writable. They allow you to both read data from a source and write data to a destination simultaneously.

4. **Transform Streams:**
   Transform streams are a special type of duplex stream where the output data is computed based on the input data. They allow you to modify or transform the data as it passes through the stream.

**Working with Streams:**

1. **Piping Streams:**
   Piping is a technique where you connect the output of one stream to the input of another stream. This is done using the `pipe()` method.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
   const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

   readableStream.pipe(writableStream);
   ```

2. **Chaining Streams:**
   You can chain multiple streams together using the `pipe()` method to perform a sequence of operations on the data.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   const zlib = require('zlib');

   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
   const gzipStream = zlib.createGzip();
   const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt.gz');

   readableStream.pipe(gzipStream).pipe(writableStream);
   ```

3. **Handling Stream Events:**
   Streams emit various events that allow you to respond to different situations. Common events include `'data'` (when new data is available), `'end'` (when all data has been read), `'error'` (when an error occurs), and `'finish'` (when all data has been written).

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');

   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
   const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

   readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
     console.log('Received data chunk:', chunk);
   });

   writableStream.on('finish', () => {
     console.log('Writing to the file finished.');
   });
   ```

**Summary:**
- Node.js streams allow you to efficiently process data in chunks.
- There are four types of streams: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.
- You can use the `pipe()` method to connect streams together for data flow.
- Stream events like `'data'`, `'end'`, `'error'`, and `'finish'` allow you to handle different situations in the stream.

Node.js streams are a powerful tool for handling large amounts of data and for building efficient data processing pipelines. They are widely used in file I/O, network communication, data transformation, and many other scenarios where data needs to be processed in chunks rather than all at once. Streams are a fundamental part of the Node.js ecosystem and play a crucial role in building scalable and performant applications.****
