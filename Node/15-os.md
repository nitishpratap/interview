# os Module 

The `os` module is a core module in Node.js that provides utilities for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to access information about the current operating system, as well as perform various system-level tasks. The `os` module does not require any installation, as it comes pre-installed with Node.js.

**Importing the os Module:**
To use the `os` module, you need to import it first. In Node.js, you can import core modules using the `require()` function:

```javascript
const os = require('Node/15-os');
```

**Common os Methods:**

1. **`os.arch()`**:
   Returns a string representing the operating system's architecture. Possible values are "x64", "arm", "ia32", etc.

2. **`os.cpus()`**:
   Returns an array of objects containing information about each CPU/core available on the system. Each object includes properties such as `model`, `speed`, `times` (CPU times), etc.

3. **`os.freemem()`**:
   Returns the amount of free system memory in bytes.

4. **`os.totalmem()`**:
   Returns the total amount of system memory (RAM) in bytes.

5. **`os.hostname()`**:
   Returns the hostname of the operating system.

6. **`os.type()`**:
   Returns the operating system name as a string (e.g., "Linux", "Windows_NT").

7. **`os.platform()`**:
   Returns the platform name of the operating system (e.g., "linux", "win32", "darwin").

8. **`os.release()`**:
   Returns the release version of the operating system.

9. **`os.uptime()`**:
   Returns the system uptime in seconds.

10. **`os.userInfo([options])`**:
    Returns information about the current user as an object. The information includes `username`, `uid`, `gid`, `homedir`, and `shell`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const os = require('Node/15-os');

console.log('Architecture:', os.arch());
console.log('CPUs:', os.cpus());
console.log('Free Memory:', os.freemem());
console.log('Total Memory:', os.totalmem());
console.log('Hostname:', os.hostname());
console.log('OS Type:', os.type());
console.log('Platform:', os.platform());
console.log('Release:', os.release());
console.log('Uptime (seconds):', os.uptime());
console.log('User Info:', os.userInfo());
```

**Summary:**
- The `os` module in Node.js provides utilities for interacting with the operating system.
- It allows you to access information about the current operating system, such as architecture, CPU details, memory information, hostname, OS type, platform, release version, system uptime, and user information.
- You can import the `os` module using `const os = require('os');`.
- The module provides various methods to retrieve system-level information.

The `os` module is useful for gathering system-related information, such as hardware details, operating system properties, and user information, which can be beneficial for building platform-specific functionalities or for monitoring and performance analysis in Node.js applications.
