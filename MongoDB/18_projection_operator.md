Projection operators in MongoDB are used to shape the results of queries by specifying which fields should be included or excluded in the query result. These operators allow you to control the fields returned in the output and can be used to optimize query performance by reducing the data transfer between the server and the client. Below is a complete documentation of the projection operators in MongoDB:

**1. `$project` Operator:**
The `$project` operator allows you to explicitly specify which fields to include or exclude in the query result.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Include only the 'name' and 'age' fields in the query result
db.users.aggregate([
  { $project: { name: 1, age: 1 } }
]);
```

**2. `$slice` Operator:**
The `$slice` operator is used to limit the number of elements returned in an array field.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Include only the first 5 elements of the 'scores' array in the query result
db.students.aggregate([
  { $project: { scores: { $slice: [ "$scores", 5 ] } } }
]);
```

**3. `$elemMatch` Operator in Projection:**
The `$elemMatch` operator can also be used in the projection stage to select the first matching element of an array that matches a given condition.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Include the first matching element of the 'scores' array that has a score greater than 80
db.students.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, score: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 80 } } } }
]);
```

**4. `$meta` Operator:**
The `$meta` operator is used in text search queries and projection stages to include the metadata score of a text search in the query result.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Perform a text search and include the metadata score in the query result
db.articles.aggregate([
  { $match: { $text: { $search: "mongodb" } } },
  { $project: { title: 1, score: { $meta: "textScore" } } }
]);
```

**5. `$map` Operator:**
The `$map` operator applies an expression to each element in an array and returns a new array with the results.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Double the 'scores' array elements and include the new array in the query result
db.students.aggregate([
  { $project: { doubledScores: { $map: { input: "$scores", as: "score", in: { $multiply: [ "$$score", 2 ] } } } } }
]);
```

**6. `$objectToArray` Operator:**
The `$objectToArray` operator converts an object to an array of key-value pairs.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Convert the 'grades' object to an array and include it in the query result
db.students.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, grades: { $objectToArray: "$grades" } } }
]);
```
