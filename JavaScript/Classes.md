# Classes
Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation.
JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesnâ€™t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype. 
```javascript
// Defining class using es6
class Vehicle {
	constructor(name, maker, engine) {
		this.name = name;
		this.maker = maker;
		this.engine = engine;
	}
	getDetails() {
		return (`The name of the bike is ${this.name}.`)
	}
}
// Making object with the help of the constructor
let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');

console.log(bike1.name); // Hayabusa
console.log(bike2.maker); // Kawasaki
console.log(bike1.getDetails());

```
