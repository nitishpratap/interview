**process.nextTick() - Complete Documentation**

**Introduction to process.nextTick():**
`process.nextTick()` is a method provided by the Node.js `process` object. It allows a callback function to be executed asynchronously but with higher priority than other async operations like `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`. The callbacks registered with `process.nextTick()` are executed immediately after the current operation completes but before the event loop continues to the next phase.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
process.nextTick(callback[, ...args]);
```

- `callback`: The function to be executed asynchronously.
- `...args` (optional): Arguments to be passed to the callback function.

**Usage:**
`process.nextTick()` is used to schedule a callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, right after the current operation is completed. This is useful when you want to ensure that a particular callback is executed before any other I/O or timer callbacks.

Example of using process.nextTick():
```javascript
console.log('Before process.nextTick');

process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('Inside process.nextTick callback');
});

console.log('After process.nextTick');
```

Output:
```
Before process.nextTick
After process.nextTick
Inside process.nextTick callback
```

In this example, the callback passed to `process.nextTick()` is executed immediately after the current operation (console.log) is completed, even before other asynchronous operations like `setImmediate` or `setTimeout`.

**Use Cases for process.nextTick():**
1. **Microtasks:** When you want to schedule a callback to be executed as a microtask, i.e., right after the current task completes, you can use `process.nextTick()`. Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks like `setImmediate` and `setTimeout`.

2. **Breaking Up Long-Running Tasks:** If you have a long-running synchronous task that may block the event loop, you can break up the task by using `process.nextTick()`. By inserting `process.nextTick()` calls at strategic points within the task, you allow other I/O and timer callbacks to be processed.

**Comparison with setImmediate and setTimeout:**
While `process.nextTick()`, `setImmediate()`, and `setTimeout(fn, 0)` are all used to schedule callbacks to be executed asynchronously, they have some key differences:

1. Priority: `process.nextTick()` has the highest priority and executes its callbacks before both `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout(fn, 0)`.

2. Timing: `process.nextTick()` callbacks are executed immediately after the current operation, whereas `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout(fn, 0)` callbacks are executed in the next iteration of the event loop.

3. Microtasks vs. Macrotasks: `process.nextTick()` schedules microtasks, while `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout(fn, 0)` schedule macrotasks. Microtasks are executed before macrotasks in the event loop.

**Summary:**
- `process.nextTick()` is a method provided by the Node.js `process` object to schedule a callback to be executed as a microtask, with higher priority than other async operations like `setImmediate` and `setTimeout`.
- It allows you to execute a callback immediately after the current operation completes, before the event loop moves to the next phase.
- Use `process.nextTick()` when you want to schedule a high-priority callback or break up long-running synchronous tasks to allow other asynchronous operations to be processed.
- It has higher priority than `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout(fn, 0)`.
- `process.nextTick()` is especially useful for scheduling microtasks that need to be executed immediately after the current operation completes.

Using `process.nextTick()` properly can help you optimize the order of execution of asynchronous operations in your Node.js applications, ensuring that critical tasks are executed with higher priority and without unnecessary delays in the event loop.
