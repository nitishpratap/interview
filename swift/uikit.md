# UIView 
UIView in UIKit - Complete Documentation

UIView is a fundamental class in UIKit that represents a rectangular area on the screen and serves as a building block for creating visual elements in iOS applications. It provides a versatile set of properties, methods, and functionality to handle various aspects of the view's appearance and behavior. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of UIView and its capabilities.

Creating a UIView:
To create a UIView instance programmatically, you can use the initializer `init(frame:)` or create it through Interface Builder. Here's an example of creating a UIView programmatically:

```swift
let view = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
```

## Properties:

1. frame: Defines the position and size of the view within its superview. It is represented by a CGRect, specifying the origin (x, y) and size (width, height) of the view.

```swift
view.frame = CGRect(x: 20, y: 40, width: 200, height: 100)
```

2. bounds: Represents the view's internal coordinate space, starting from (0, 0) and extending to the width and height of the view.

3. center: Specifies the center point of the view within its superview.

4. backgroundColor: Sets the background color of the view.

```swift
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.red
```

5. alpha: Controls the transparency of the view. A value of 1.0 represents full opacity, while 0.0 represents complete transparency.

6. isHidden: Indicates whether the view is hidden or visible. When set to true, the view becomes invisible.

7. isUserInteractionEnabled: Specifies whether user interactions are enabled for the view. If set to false, user interactions will be ignored.

8. tag: An integer value that can be used to identify the view.

Methods:

1. addSubview(_:): Adds a subview to the view hierarchy. The added view becomes a child of the current view.

```swift
parentView.addSubview(childView)
```

2. removeFromSuperview(): Removes the view from its superview, detaching it from the view hierarchy.

```swift
view.removeFromSuperview()
```

3. bringSubview(toFront:): Changes the z-ordering of a subview, bringing it to the front.

```swift
parentView.bringSubview(toFront: view)
```

4. sendSubview(toBack:): Changes the z-ordering of a subview, sending it to the back.

```swift
parentView.sendSubview(toBack: view)
```

5. removeFromSuperview(): Removes the view from its superview, detaching it from the view hierarchy.

```swift
view.removeFromSuperview()
```

6. setNeedsLayout(): Invalidates the current layout of the view and triggers a layout update.

```swift
view.setNeedsLayout()
```

7. layoutIfNeeded(): Forces an immediate layout update if any pending changes exist.

```swift
view.layoutIfNeeded()
```

8. addGestureRecognizer(_:): Attaches a gesture recognizer to the view to detect and handle gestures.

```swift
view.addGestureRecognizer(gestureRecognizer)
```

9. setNeedsDisplay(): Marks the view as needing a redraw, triggering a call to the `draw(_:)` method.

```swift
view.setNeedsDisplay()
```

## Inheritance:
UIView inherits from UIResponder and acts as the base class for various UI elements like UILabel, UIButton, UITextField, and more. It provides a common set of properties and methods that are shared among all UIView subclasses.

Subviews and View Hierarchy:
A UIView can have one or more subviews, forming a hierarchical structure. The superview is the parent view that contains the current view, and the subviews are the child views
ChatGPT
. You can add, remove, and manage subviews using the aforementioned methods.

UIView's layoutSubviews() Method:
UIView provides the `layoutSubviews()` method, which you can override to perform custom layout adjustments within the view. This method is called when the view's layout needs to be updated, such as when its frame changes or when you manually call `setNeedsLayout()`.

Auto Layout:
Auto Layout is a powerful layout system provided by UIKit that allows you to create adaptive and flexible user interfaces. With Auto Layout, you can define relationships and constraints between views to create dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

Gesture Recognizers:
UIView supports gesture recognition through gesture recognizers. Gesture recognizers are objects that recognize specific gestures, such as taps, swipes, or pinches, and trigger actions when those gestures occur on the view.

UIView Animation:
UIView provides built-in support for basic animations. You can animate changes to view properties, such as frame, alpha, or transform, to create smooth and visually appealing transitions.

This documentation covers the essential properties and methods of UIView in UIKit. UIView is a versatile class that forms the backbone of the user interface in iOS applications. By leveraging the capabilities of UIView, you can create rich and interactive user interfaces tailored to your specific application requirements.

You can create custom UITableViewCell subclasses to define the appearance and behavior of cells.

```swift
class CustomCell: UITableViewCell {
    // Custom cell implementation
}
```

## Inheritance:
UITableView inherits from UIScrollView, which in turn inherits from UIView. It provides scrolling and zooming capabilities along with the table view features.

Example Implementation:

Here's an example implementation of a basic UITableView:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate {

    let tableView = UITableView()
    let data = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        tableView.frame = view.bounds
        tableView.dataSource
ChatGPT
 = self
        tableView.delegate = self
        tableView.register(UITableViewCell.self, forCellReuseIdentifier: "Cell")
        view.addSubview(tableView)
    }

    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return data.count
    }

    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath)
        cell.textLabel?.text = data[indexPath.row]
        return cell
    }

    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        // Handle row selection
        print("Selected item: \(data[indexPath.row])")
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic UITableView implementation with a simple list of items. The table view displays the data array, and the selected item is printed to the console when a row is selected.

UITableView offers extensive customization options, including different cell types, headers, footers, and section indexes. It provides a flexible and powerful way to present tabular data in iOS applications.

# UIScrollView with implemenatation

UIScrollView in UIKit - Complete Documentation

UIScrollView is a versatile class in UIKit that enables users to scroll and zoom content that is larger than the visible area. It provides a scrollable view container for displaying content such as images, text, or custom views. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of UIScrollView and its capabilities, along with an example implementation.

## Creating a UIScrollView:
To create a UIScrollView, you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize a UIScrollView instance either programmatically or using Interface Builder.
2. Set the contentSize property to define the size of the scrollable content.
3. Add subviews to the scroll view to display the content.

```swift
let scrollView = UIScrollView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
scrollView.contentSize = CGSize(width: 400, height: 400)
```

Scrolling and Zooming:
UIScrollView provides built-in support for scrolling and zooming. You can enable scrolling in both horizontal and vertical directions and adjust the zoom scale to allow users to zoom in and out on the content.

## Properties:

1. contentOffset: The current scroll position of the scroll view.
2. contentSize: The size of the content that is scrollable within the scroll view.
3. contentInset: The insets for the scrollable content, useful for adding spacing around the content.
4. isScrollEnabled: A boolean value indicating whether scrolling is enabled or not.
5. minimumZoomScale: The minimum scale factor allowed for zooming.
6. maximumZoomScale: The maximum scale factor allowed for zooming.
7. zoomScale: The current scale factor of the scroll view when zoomed.

```swift
scrollView.isScrollEnabled = true
scrollView.minimumZoomScale = 0.5
scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 2.0
```

## UIScrollViewDelegate:
UIScrollViewDelegate is a protocol that defines methods for tracking and responding to scroll view events and interactions.

Methods:

1. viewForZooming(in:): Returns the view that should be zoomed in response to a zoom gesture.

```swift
func viewForZooming(in scrollView: UIScrollView) -> UIView? {
    return imageView
}
```

2. scrollViewDidScroll(_:): Called when the scroll view's content offset changes.

```swift
func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
    // Handle scroll event
}
```

Example Implementation:

Here's an example implementation of a UIScrollView:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {

    let scrollView = UIScrollView()
    let imageView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "large_image"))

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        scrollView.frame = view.bounds
        scrollView.contentSize = imageView.bounds.size
        scrollView.delegate = self

        scrollView.addSubview(imageView)
        view.addSubview(scrollView)
    }

    func viewForZooming(in scrollView: UIScrollView) -> UIView? {
        return imageView
    }
}
```

In this example, a UIScrollView is created and added to the view hierarchy. An UIImageView is added as a subview to the scroll view to display a large image. The UIScrollViewDelegate method `viewForZooming(in:)` is implemented to specify the view that should be zoomed in response to zoom gestures.

UIScrollView offers flexible scrolling and zooming capabilities, allowing you to display and interact with content that extends beyond the visible area. It is a fundamental component in building scrollable interfaces in iOS applications.

# layout constraints

Auto Layout and Layout Constraints - Complete Documentation

Auto Layout is a powerful layout system in iOS that allows you to create adaptive and flexible user interfaces. It uses layout constraints to define the relationships and rules for positioning and sizing views within a view hierarchy. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of Auto Layout and layout constraints, along with examples of their implementation.

Introduction to Auto Layout:
Auto Layout is designed to handle the dynamic nature of iOS device screens, accommodating different screen sizes, orientations, and localization. It provides a declarative way to express the desired relationships between views, allowing the system to automatically calculate the correct layout based on these constraints.

Key Concepts:

1. Views: In Auto Layout, views are the building blocks of the user interface. They can be any subclass of UIView, such as UILabel, UIButton, or UIImageView.

2. Constraints: Constraints define the rules for the layout of views. They specify how views should be positioned and sized relative to each other and the container view. Constraints are expressed as relationships between attributes of views, such as leading, trailing, top, bottom, width, height, and more.

3. Layout Anchors: Layout anchors provide a concise way to create layout constraints. They are properties on UIView that represent specific edges or dimensions of a view.

4. NSLayoutConstraint: NSLayoutConstraint is the class used to create individual layout constraints. It defines the relationship between two layout anchors or between a layout anchor and a constant value.

5. Autoresizing Mask: Autoresizing mask is the legacy layout system in iOS that uses autoresizing masks to determine how views should resize or reposition when their superview's bounds change. Auto Layout and autoresizing mask can coexist in the same view hierarchy, but Auto Layout takes precedence.

Layout Constraints Types:

1. Position Constraints: These constraints define the horizontal and vertical positioning of views, such as leading, trailing, top, bottom, centerX, centerY, and more.

2. Size Constraints: These constraints control the width and height of views, such as widthAnchor and heightAnchor.

3. Relationship Constraints: These constraints define the relationship between two views, such as equal width, equal height, aspect ratio, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, and more.

Implementing Layout Constraints:

There are two common ways to implement layout constraints in iOS:

1. Programmatically: You can create and activate NSLayoutConstraint instances directly in code using the NSLayoutConstraint API or the layout anchors API. Here's an example of creating and activating constraints programmatically:

```swift
view1.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view2.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

// Position constraints
view1.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
view1.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor, constant: 40).isActive = true

// Size constraints
view1.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100).isActive = true
view1.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 50).isActive = true

// Relationship constraints
view2.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view1.trailingAnchor, constant: 20).isActive = true
view2.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view1.centerYAnchor).isActive = true
```

2. Interface Builder: You can use Interface Builder, the visual design tool in Xcode, to define layout constraints graphically. Interface Builder allows you to create and manage constraints by control-dragging between views and setting their attributes in the inspector. Interface Builder generates the necessary NSLayoutConstraint instances behind the scenes.

Auto Layout Engine:

The Auto Layout engine in iOS automatically calculates and updates the layout based on the defined constraints. It solves the constraints to find a valid layout configuration that satisfies all the constraints and adjusts the views accordingly. When constraints change, such as during device rotation or content updates, the system automatically updates the layout to maintain consistency.

Autoresizing Masks:

Autoresizing masks are a legacy mechanism
ChatGPT
 for handling view resizing. They are a set of boolean masks that determine how a view should resize in response to its superview's bounds change. Autoresizing masks can be configured in Interface Builder or programmatically using the autoresizingMask property of UIView.

Compatibility with Size Classes:

Size classes are an abstraction in iOS that allow you to design adaptive layouts for different device sizes and orientations. Auto Layout works in conjunction with size classes to enable dynamic layout adjustments based on the current size class.

Auto Layout is a powerful and flexible layout system in iOS that provides adaptive and responsive user interfaces. By defining layout constraints, you can create complex and dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.


# Delegates in Swift - Complete Documentation

Delegates are a design pattern commonly used in Swift and other object-oriented programming languages. They allow one object to communicate and pass data or events to another object. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of delegates in Swift, along with examples of their implementation.


:
Delegates provide a way for objects to delegate tasks or responsibilities to another object. In Swift, delegates are typically implemented using protocols, where a protocol defines a set of methods and properties that the delegate should implement.

## Key Concepts:

1. Protocol: A protocol in Swift is a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that a class, structure, or enumeration can conform to. Protocols define the interface that delegates must adhere to.

2. Delegate: A delegate is an object that conforms to a protocol and acts on behalf of another object. It receives messages and callbacks from the delegating object to perform specific tasks or provide information.

3. Delegating Object: The delegating object is the object that needs to communicate with its delegate. It holds a weak reference to the delegate and sends messages to it when specific events or actions occur.

## Implementing Delegates:

To implement delegates in Swift, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define a protocol that specifies the methods or properties the delegate should implement.

```swift
protocol MyDelegate {
    func didReceiveData(data: Any)
}
```

2. Declare a weak variable of the delegate type in the delegating class.

```swift
class MyDelegatingClass {
    weak var delegate: MyDelegate?
}
```

3. When an event occurs or data needs to be passed, call the delegate's methods.

```swift
func processData() {
    // Process data
    delegate?.didReceiveData(data: processedData)
}
```

4. Assign a delegate to the delegating object.

```swift
let delegatingObject = MyDelegatingClass()
let delegateObject = DelegateClass()
delegatingObject.delegate = delegateObject
```

Example Implementation:

Here's an example implementation of delegates in Swift:

```swift
protocol DataManagerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didReceiveData(data: [String])
}

class DataManager {
    weak var delegate: DataManagerDelegate?

    func fetchData() {
        // Simulate data fetching
        let data = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
        delegate?.didReceiveData(data: data)
    }
}

class ViewController: UIViewController, DataManagerDelegate {
    let dataManager = DataManager()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        dataManager.delegate = self
        dataManager.fetchData()
    }

    func didReceiveData(data: [String]) {
        // Handle received data
        print("Received data: \(data)")
    }
}
```

In this example, a DataManager class fetches data and notifies its delegate when the data is received. The ViewController class conforms to the DataManagerDelegate protocol and acts as the delegate. It receives the data through the `didReceiveData(data:)` method and handles it accordingly.

 Delegates are a powerful mechanism for communication between objects in Swift. They promote loose coupling and separation of concerns, allowing for modular and reusable code. By defining and implementing delegates, you can establish flexible and customizable interactions between different components of your application.

# uiImageview and uiimage include how can i show image from a url.

UIImageView - Complete Documentation

UIImageView is a fundamental component in UIKit that provides a way to display images in iOS and macOS applications. It is a subclass of UIView and provides various properties and methods to manage and manipulate images. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of UIImageView, its key features, and examples of usage.

Key Features of UIImageView:

1. Image Display: UIImageView is primarily used to display images. It supports various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and GIF. You can set the image to be displayed using the `image` property or by assigning a UIImage object.

2. Content Modes: UIImageView offers different content modes (`contentMode`) that define how the image is displayed within the view's bounds. Content modes allow you to control aspects such as scaling, aspect ratio, and alignment of the image.

3. Animation: UIImageView provides support for animating a sequence of images. You can assign an array of UIImage objects to the `animationImages` property and control the animation parameters, such as duration and repeat count.

4. Tinting: UIImageView supports image tinting by setting the `tintColor` property. This allows you to apply a color overlay to the image, which can be useful for highlighting or customizing image appearance.

5. Interaction: UIImageView inherits from UIView, so it can respond to user interactions such as taps and gestures. You can attach gesture recognizers or implement the appropriate delegate methods to handle user interactions with the image view.

### Displaying an Image from a URL:

To display an image from a URL in a UIImageView, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a URL object representing the image's location.

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/image.jpg") else {
    // Handle invalid URL
    return
}
```

2. Download the image data from the URL.

```swift
guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else {
    // Handle failed data download
    return
}
```

3. Create a UIImage object from the downloaded data.

```swift
guard let image = UIImage(data: data) else {
    // Handle invalid image data
    return
}
```

4. Assign the UIImage object to the `image` property of the UIImageView.

```swift
imageView.image = image
```

Example Usage:

Here's an example of using UIImageView to display an image from a URL:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        guard let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/image.jpg") else {
            return
        }

        DispatchQueue.global().async {
            if let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url),
               let image = UIImage(data: data) {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.imageView.image = image
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the image is downloaded asynchronously using a background queue to avoid blocking the main thread. Once the image data is downloaded and a UIImage object is created, the assignment to the `imageView.image` property is done on the main thread.

UIImageView provides a straightforward way to display images in iOS and macOS applications. By utilizing its properties and methods, you can effectively manage and customize the image display based on your application's requirements.

UIImageView - Complete Documentation

UIImageView is a fundamental component in UIKit that provides a way to display images in iOS and macOS applications. It is a subclass of UIView and provides various properties and methods to manage and manipulate images.

Creating UIImageView:
```swift
let imageView = UIImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
```
This creates a new UIImageView instance with a specified frame (position and size).

Setting the Image:
```swift
imageView.image = UIImage(named: "image_name")
```
You can set the image to be displayed in the UIImageView by assigning a UIImage object to the `image` property. The UIImage can be created using various methods, such as providing the name of an image asset or the contents of an image file.

Content Mode:
```swift
imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
```
The `contentMode` property determines how the image is displayed within the bounds of the UIImageView. You can set it to different values, such as `.scaleAspectFit`, `.scaleAspectFill`, `.center`, etc., to control the image's aspect ratio, scaling, and alignment.

### Animating Images:
```swift
imageView.animationImages = [UIImage(named: "image1"), UIImage(named: "image2"), UIImage(named: "image3")]
imageView.animationDuration = 1.0
imageView.startAnimating()
```
UIImageView supports animating a sequence of images. You can assign an array of UIImage objects to the `animationImages` property and control the animation duration using the `animationDuration` property. Call `startAnimating()` to begin the animation.

Tinting:
```swift
imageView.tintColor = UIColor.red
```
You can apply a tint color to the image using the `tintColor` property. This applies a color overlay to the image, which can be useful for highlighting or customizing the appearance.

Interaction:
```swift
imageView.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
```
By default, UIImageView does not respond to user interactions. Set `isUserInteractionEnabled` to `true` if you want the image view to handle user interactions such as taps or gestures. You can attach gesture recognizers or implement the appropriate delegate methods to handle user interactions with the image view.

Example Usage:
```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        let imageView = UIImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
        imageView.image = UIImage(named: "my_image")
        imageView.contentMode = .scaleAspectFit
        imageView.animationImages = [UIImage(named: "image1"), UIImage(named: "image2"), UIImage(named: "image3")]
        imageView.animationDuration = 1.0
        imageView.startAnimating()
        
        self.view.addSubview(imageView)
    }
}
```
In this example, a UIImageView is created and configured with an image, content mode, and animation. The image view is then added as a subview to the view controller's view.

UIImageView provides a flexible and easy-to-use way to display images in iOS and macOS applications. By leveraging its properties and methods, you can customize image presentation, handle user interactions, and animate image sequences.

# how to call api and update ui based on api response in uikit
ChatGPT
To call an API and update the UI based on the API response in UIKit, you can follow these steps:

1. Make an API Request:
   - Create an instance of `URLSession` to handle the network request.
   - Create a `URLRequest` with the URL of the API endpoint and configure it with the necessary parameters, headers, and HTTP method.
   - Create a data task using `URLSession`'s `dataTask(with:completionHandler:)` method, passing in the request and a completion handler.

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/endpoint") else { return }

let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    // Process API response
    if let error = error {
        // Handle error
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        return
    }

    // Parse the response data
    if let data = data {
        do {
            let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: [])
            // Process the JSON data
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                // Update UI based on the API response
                // ...
            }
        } catch {
            // Handle JSON parsing error
            print("Error parsing JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}

// Start the API request
task.resume()
```

2. Process the API Response:
   - In the completion handler of the data task, you can process the API response.
   - Check for any errors that occurred during the request. If an error exists, handle it accordingly.
   - Parse the response data, usually in JSON format, using `JSONSerialization` or a JSON decoding library like `Codable`.
   - Process the parsed response data and update the UI accordingly. Since UI updates should be performed on the main thread, wrap the UI update code inside `DispatchQueue.main.async`.

3. Update the UI:
   - Inside the completion handler or after processing the API response, update the UI based on the received data.
   - This can involve populating labels, displaying images, updating table or collection views, or any other UI element.
   - Make sure to wrap UI updates in `DispatchQueue.main.async` if they are performed from a background queue.

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    // Update UI based on the API response
    // ...
}
```

By following these steps, you can call an API and update the UI based on the received data in a UIKit-based application. Remember to handle errors appropriately and ensure that UI updates are performed on the main thread.
User
suppose i have a data in json.
how can i covert that to object or structure in swift
ChatGPT
In Swift, you can convert JSON data to objects or structures using the Codable protocol. Codable is a protocol that combines the functionalities of the Encodable and Decodable protocols, allowing you to easily encode and decode data between JSON and Swift types.

Here's how you can convert JSON data to an object or structure in Swift:

1. Define your Swift type that represents the structure of your JSON data. This type should conform to the Codable protocol.

```swift
struct MyData: Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    // Include other properties that match the JSON structure
}
```

2. Obtain the JSON data from your API response or any other source.

```swift
guard let jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8) else {
    // Handle invalid JSON data
    return
}
```

Note: If you already have a JSON string, you can convert it to data using the `data(using: .utf8)` method.

3. Use JSONDecoder to decode the JSON data into your Swift type.

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
do {
    let myData = try decoder.decode(MyData.self, from: jsonData)
    // Use the decoded object (myData) as needed
    print(myData.name)
} catch {
    // Handle JSON decoding error
    print("Error decoding JSON: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

4. The JSONDecoder's `decode(_:from:)` method is used to decode the JSON data into the specified Swift type. In this case, it decodes the JSON data into an instance of `MyData`. If the decoding process fails, an error is thrown and can be handled in the catch block.

By following these steps, you can convert JSON data into an object or structure in Swift using Codable. The Codable protocol simplifies the process of converting between JSON and Swift types, making it easier to work with JSON data in your application.
