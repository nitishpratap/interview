**`useMemo` Hook in React**

The `useMemo` hook is used to optimize the performance of expensive calculations or computations in React. It memoizes the result of a function and returns the cached result when the dependencies (inputs) haven't changed since the last render. This helps avoid unnecessary re-computation, especially when dealing with computationally expensive operations.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  // Expensive calculation or computation
  return result;
}, [dependency1, dependency2, ...]);
```

- `() => {}`: The function that performs the expensive calculation or computation.
- `dependency1, dependency2, ...`: An array of dependencies that, when changed, will trigger the recalculation of the memoized value.

**Example: Using `useMemo` to Calculate Fibonacci Numbers**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const fib = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
};

const FibonacciComponent = () => {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(1);

  // Memoize the result of the fib function
  const result = useMemo(() => fib(number), [number]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fibonacci Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        Calculate Fibonacci number for: 
        <input
          type="number"
          value={number}
          onChange={(e) => setNumber(parseInt(e.target.value))}
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Fibonacci Number for {number}: <strong>{result}</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FibonacciComponent;
```

In this example, we have a simple React component `FibonacciComponent` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. We use `useMemo` to memoize the result of the `fib` function, which recursively calculates the Fibonacci number for the given `number`. The memoization ensures that the expensive calculation of Fibonacci numbers is only performed when the `number` state changes.

When the user inputs a new number in the input field, the `number` state is updated, and the `result` will be recalculated only if the `number` changes. Otherwise, the cached result from the previous render will be used, avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

**When to Use `useMemo`:**

- Use `useMemo` when you have computationally expensive operations that rely on certain dependencies and don't need to be recalculated on every render.
- Use it to optimize the performance of derived or computed values from state or props.

**Note:**

- Only use `useMemo` when necessary, as memoization comes with some trade-offs and may not always provide a significant performance boost for simple computations or small datasets.
- React will recompute the memoized value whenever any of the dependencies change. Ensure that the dependencies are stable and do not change frequently during the component's lifecycle.

React's implementation and features may evolve over time. For the latest and most accurate information on `useMemo` and other hooks, refer to the official React documentation.
